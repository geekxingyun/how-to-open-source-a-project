This document describes how to build the open source project from the command line and how to import the Spring Framework projects into an IDE.

## 1.1 Before You Start

To build you will need [Git](https://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect) and [JDK 8 update 60 or later](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Be sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the jdk1.8.0 folder extracted from the JDK download.

## 1.2 Get the Source Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geekxingyun/how-to-open-source-a-project.git
```
or
```bash
git clone git@github.com:geekxingyun/how-to-open-source-a-project.git
```
